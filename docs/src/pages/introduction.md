# Introdution

`@mrcaidev/hooks` is a collection of React utility hooks.

## Features

- **Fully typed:** Enjoy 100% type safety with TypeScript.
- **Server ready:** SSG/SSR support out of the box.
- **Lightweight:** <3KB gzipped. Tree-shaking supported.

## Try it Out

> Interested, but too lazy to create another repository for it?

No worries, we have prepared a [playground](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/thirsty-chaum-9oplqq) for you to try out the hooks right in the browser.

This is also the official CodeSandbox template to create a minimal reproducible example.

## Contributing

Please read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/mrcaidev/hooks/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before any contribution.

> Currently this is really just a personal project. I'm trying to build a library that can make me proud of, while also learning React and Web APIs. But if you decide to help out, I believe it will definitely make this project better, and we can surely learn a lot from each other.
