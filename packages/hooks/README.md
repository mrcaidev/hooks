Please read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/mrcaidev/hooks/tree/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before any contribution.

> Currently this is really just a personal project. I'm trying to build a library that can make me proud of, while also learning React and Web APIs. But if you decide to help out, I believe it will definitely make this project better, and we can surely learn a lot from each other.
